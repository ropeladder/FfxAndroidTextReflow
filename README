Click to reflow text to fit screen size on Android. This is a fork and an
almost exact copy of https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/text-reflow/
- the difference being that it is enabled for all pageses by default and 
source code including build script is easier available in
   https://github.com/rgh36167/FfxAndroidTextReflow

Please see original addon for some more information.

It will reflow one paragraph of text at a time when you tap on it.
It won't work with hyperlinks or elements which are otherwise clickable.
You can disable it for a single page in the menu - currently it won't
remember this setting, or globally simply by disabling the extension.

I will be very happy the day when this addon will be rendered useless 
by enabling this capability in Firefox!
