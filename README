Click to reflow text to fit screen size on Android. 


After pinch to zoom current Firefox versions on Android do not reflow
text to fit the screen, making excessive horizontal scrolling necessary
to read the text.

With this extension you can tap the zoomed text and it will be reflowed to
fit the screen. Normally one chunk of text at a click will be reflowed, 
though an option to try to reflow a whole column of text exists now. 
To read a longer text you may have to do this many times to reflow each 
piece of text separately. 

Clicking the text again will un-reflow it.

To reflow clickable text (hyperlinks) try a double-tap (see options). This addon
does redefine the double-click event unless this functionality is disabled in
the settings!

This addon started as fork of 
  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/text-reflow/

Differences to the original:
* enabled by default for all pages
* tries to reflow more text at a time (see option)
* configurable side margins
* options to reflow on double-click and disable default double-click handler
* option to disable default single-click handler (handy if you click links by accident too often but some things wont work)
* rewritten to use addon-SDK
* source code in github https://github.com/rgh36167/FfxAndroidTextReflow

Some settings (options) are configurable in Tools/Addons//AndroidTextReflow.
All changes to settings take effect only after all pages are reloaded!

Please also see the original addon page for some more information. You may
also want to use the original addon if you prefer to have click-to-reflow
disabled by default and only available after enabling it in the menu.

If you find yourself that you need to zoom pages very frequently to make
them readable you may also try to change the
 "layout.css.devPixelsPerPx"
value in "about:config" - a value like 2.4 makes the texts much
larger. Larger values than that should be used with great caution as
they may distort many internal configuration pages and menus.

I will be very happy the day when this addon will be rendered obsolete
by enabling this capability in Firefox!
